		  <h3>The Fine Print:</h3>
		  <p style="font-size: 0.875em;">
		  To be eligible to refer a new restaurant, you must have ordered from Miri Foods at least once in the past 3 months and have spent more than $5,000 in total during the lifetime of your account. The new restaurant must have never ordered from Miri Foods in the last 24 months. They must place orders totaling at least $5,000 within 2 months of their first order. The $200 credit for both the referring restaurant and the new restaurant must be used within 6 months of the new restaurant’s first order. To qualify for the credit, both your account and the new restaurant’s account must be in good standing and fully paid at the time the credit is issued. This offer is valid only if the new restaurant places their first order before July 1, 2025. The new restaurant must mention the referring restaurant when placing their first order. To be eligible to refer the new restaurant, the referring restaurant and the new restaurant cannot share any owner with more than a 10% stake in both businesses.
